Features
This portfolio is packed with modern features to create a memorable user experience:

Fully Responsive: The layout seamlessly adapts to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Interactive Constellation Background: A dynamic particle animation in the background reacts to mouse movement.

Engaging Scroll Animations: Sections gracefully fade and slide into view as the user scrolls down the page.

Typing Hero Text: The main headline animates with a typing effect, cycling through different professional titles.

3D Tilt Effect: Cards have a subtle 3D tilt effect on hover, adding a layer of depth.

Interactive Name Reveal: Personal details are initially "encrypted" and are revealed only after the visitor interacts with a rating modal, adding a fun, gamified element.

Text Scramble Effect: Section titles animate with a "decoding" effect when they appear on screen.

Single-File Architecture: All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are contained within a single index.html file for easy management and deployment.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the core structure and content.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI development.

JavaScript (ES6): To power all the animations, interactivity, and logic.
